# Credit Risk Modeling
Modeling Expected Loss to identify customers that can default on a given loan in future and estimated capital requirement (Capital Adequacy or regulatory capital)

Expected Loss = PD * EAD * LGD
where PD = Probability of default (Works on Logisitic Regression)
LGD = Loss given default (Works on Linear Regression)
EAD = Exposure at default (Works on Linear Regression)

Following techniques are used to build the statistical model:
- Weight of evidence
- Information value
- Fine classing
- Coarse classing
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Area Under the Curve
- Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
- Gini Coefficient
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov
- Assessing Population Stability
- Maintaining a model
